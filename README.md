A **modern, interactive, and beautifully animated** web application designed to create a memorable romantic proposal experience.  
Built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML — no framework dependencies.  
Every visit feels unique thanks to dynamic content, smooth 3D animations, and a clever “No” button that evolves with the interaction.

**Made with ❤️ by [BisuG](https://github.com/bisug).**  
_This project was assisted by Google’s Antigravity and Gemini 3.0 Flash._

## ✨ Features

- **🎲 Dynamic Randomization**  
  Titles, descriptions, love letters, and success messages change on every visit. No two proposals are exactly alike.

- **🤵 Personalized Greeting**  
  Append `?name=YourSpecialSomeone` to the URL, and the main heading and love letter will automatically include the name.

- **🧠 Persistent “No” Button Logic**  
  The “No” button doesn’t just say no — it cycles through layered convincing messages and visually transforms with each click.

- **🎨 Premium Visuals**
  - Smooth 3D parchment animations and wax seal effects.
  - Floating heart particles.
  - Canvas‑powered confetti celebration on “Yes”.

- **📱 Fully Responsive**  
  Optimised for all screen sizes and orientations. No scrolling needed — a perfect single‑screen experience.

- **📬 API Ready**  
  Built‑in serverless function to record responses (POST to `/api/submit`).

## 🚀 Deployment

You can deploy your own instance in one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbisug%2Fvalentine)  
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/bisug/valentine)

Both platforms automatically detect the serverless function and handle routing.

## 🛠️ Customization & Usage

### 🔹 Personalized Greeting

Add a `name` query parameter to the URL. The main title and the letter inside the envelope will reflect the provided name.

**Example:**

```
https://your-domain.com/?name=Sarah
```

If no name is provided, the app falls back to a generic greeting.

### 🔹 Changing the Love Letter & Messages

All randomised content is stored in plain JavaScript arrays inside `index.html`.  
Look for variables like `titles`, `descriptions`, `letterContents`, and `successMessages`.  
Modify or extend them to match your own style.

---

## 📡 API Endpoint

The app submits responses to a serverless function located at `/api/submit`.  
It accepts `POST` requests with the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Sarah",
  "response": "YES",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-12T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The function is pre‑configured for Vercel / Netlify. You can extend it to store responses in a database, send emails, etc.

## 💻 Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bisug/valentine.git
   cd valentine
   ```

2. **Run a local server**  
   Because the app uses ES6 modules and the `?name` parameter, you need a local web server.
   - If you have Python:
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server
     ```
   - If you have Node.js:
     ```bash
     npx serve
     ```

3. **Open in browser**  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown).

4. **Test the serverless function locally**
   - **Vercel:** Install Vercel CLI and run `vercel dev`.
   - **Netlify:** Install Netlify CLI and run `netlify dev`.
